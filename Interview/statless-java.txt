A stateless session bean is a type of enterprise bean, which is normally used to perform independent operations. A stateless session bean as per its name does not have any associated client state, but it may preserve its instance state. EJB Container normally creates a pool of few stateless bean's objects and use these objects to process client's request. Because of pool, instance variable values are not guaranteed to be same across lookups/method calls.


The stateless bean objects are pooled by the EJB container to service the request on demand.

It can be accessed by one client at a time. In case of concurrent access, EJB container routes each request to different instance.
