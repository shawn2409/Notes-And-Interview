Understand mechanism of find 2nd largest number 
Use debug to understand how 2nd largest number is getting called but 
Arays.sort() makes more is easy if not in order and can not print it out
See example SecondLargestArray on github example on your project 
int arr[] = { 14, 46, 47, 86, 92, 52, 48, 36, 66, 85 };
Without arrays.sort() will not print thirdlargest number , understand doing debug why
