Interface can extended multiple interfaces but can not implement interface or abstract
Abstract class can not extends or in general any class can not extends multple abstract or general class 
but implement multiple interfaces


Ternary Operator - ?: (use as if else condition)
Programmers use ternary operators in C for decision making inplace of conditional statements if and else. The ternary operator is an operator that takes three arguments. The first argument is a comparison

Upcasting-Vs-Downcasting
Upcasting: Upcasting is the typecasting of a child object to a parent object. Upcasting can be done implicitly. Upcasting gives us the flexibility to access the parent class members but it is not possible to access all the child class members using this feature. Instead of all the members, we can access some specified members of the child class. For instance, we can access the overridden methods.
Downcasting: Similarly, downcasting means the typecasting of a parent object to a child object. Downcasting cannot be implicitly.

// Upcasting 
        Parent p = new Child(); 
        p.name = "GeeksforGeeks";
        // Downcasting Explicitly 
        Child c = (Child)p; 
with downcasting can able to inherit parents properties or variables.
