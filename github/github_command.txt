Add remote url 
The git remote add command takes two arguments:
* A remote name, for example, origin
* A remote URL, for example, https://github.com/user/repo.git
For example:
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
# Set a new remote

$ git remote -v
# Verify new remote
> origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)


#add local and remote branch
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1519006/how-do-you-create-a-remote-git-branch
First, you create your branch locally:
git checkout -b <branch-name> # Create a new branch and check it out
The remote branch is automatically created when you push it to the remote server. So when you feel ready for it, you can do:
git push <remote-name> <branch-name>
Where <remote-name> is typically origin,

#add all file or add individual file
#git add * or git add file.name

#undo commit
Git Reset

Git remove or reset url 
git remote -v
# View existing remotes
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/user/repo2.git
# Change the 'origin' remote's URL

git: updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally
git push -f origin master  =-f force 
It over rides the repo if not pull first and migrate

====================================================================================================

Set up remote repo then pull first before commit and push

=====
check out branch remote
$ git fetch or git fetch origin dev
$ git checkout <branch>
