# Set a new remote

$ git remote -v
# Verify new remote
> origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)

#add all file or add individual file
#git add * or git add file.name


#undo commit
Git Reset

Git remove or reset url 
git remote -v
# View existing remotes
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/user/repo2.git
# Change the 'origin' remote's URL

git remote -v
# Verify new remote URL
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo2.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo2.git (push)


git: updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally
git push -f origin master  =-f force 
It over rides the repo if not pull first and migrate

=====

Set up remote repo then pull first before commit and push
