Interview question 
Difference between hash map and hash table

What is the immutable custom class , how to create

Does auto sub packge load when parent package
No

How the map internal works



A collision occurs when a hash function returns same bucket location for two different keys. ... A collision will occur when two different keys have the same hashCode, which can happen because two unequal objects in Java can have the same hashCode.
It can be avoided by having each bucket contain a linked list of elements that are hashed to that bucket. This is why a bad hash function can make lookup in hash tables very slow.

**Map notes
Non generic map can do iterator without declaring datatypes in map <>
Generic instance must need to declare datatypes if do not want to use iterator and only use Enhencefor loop
for(Map.Entry m: map.entrySet()).
